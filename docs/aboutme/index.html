				<h2><strong>My view on research</strong></h2>
				<p>I like two things about research. First, it feeds my curiosity: <b>it's always fun to learn new things!</b> Neutrino pheno is a particularly good field to learn different skills and acquire a broad perspective on the status of particle physics.
				Second, it is a collective effort: <b>we're all in the same ship</b>. I try to make my work useful to others (even if only a little and to a few). Thus, it is no secret that I love the communicative part of my research.
				As long as science is my job, I will focus on these: having fun doing it and helping a wider community.</p>

				<h2><strong>Forging a community</strong></h2>
				<p>Academia is competitive, and that is how it is, but there is room for improvement in terms of diversity and inclusivity. I feel incredibly lucky to have made wonderful friends during my PhD, and I strive to <b>give back this warmth</b> to my communities. I actively participate in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Commissions, coordinate mentoring programs for Masterâ€™s students, and organize informal PhD meetings at my university. The difficulty of an academic career is no excuse for not working to <b>make it a better place</b>.

				<h2><strong>Me, beyond research</strong></h2>
				<p>Since we are not defined only by our projects, I am a person who likes to listen and embrace the present moment. I enjoy hugs and <b>always try to keep a warm smile</b>.<br> I am in love with my birthplace, which is not just Barcelona. I cherish its nature, its sea, its mountains, its culture, and its community. Oh, and <i>croquetes</i>. It's all of this and the people I love which make me feel fulfilled.<br>
				That being said, I am absolutely looking forward to find and build other communities abroad.
